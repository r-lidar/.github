## r-lidar

[`r-lidar`](https://www.r-lidar.com/) is developing free and open-source airborne laser processing software primarily designed for the R programming language. Our two main products are the `lidR` and `lasR` packages, each targeting different usages. We also provide professional paid services, including training courses, development, counseling, and R&D. See more details on our website [r-lidar.com](https://www.r-lidar.com/).

- [`lidR`](https://github.com/r-lidar/lidR) is tailored for research and development, originally developed at Laval University. It allows the handy manipulation of lidar data within the R programming language. It has been widely used for 10 years by universities globally and has been cited in more than 1,000 scientific articles.

- [`lasR`](https://github.com/r-lidar/lasR) is tailored for highly efficient airborne lidar data processing. It was designed to be much more powerful by allowing the creation of complex and optimized processing pipelines and applying them to terabytes of data efficiently.

Our software is free. You can support the development by [sponsoring us](https://github.com/sponsors/Jean-Romain).

We also maintain other open-source projects for airborne lidar data processing in R:

- [`rlas`](https://github.com/r-lidar/rlas): R package to read and write las and laz files used to store LiDAR data
- [`RMCC`](https://github.com/r-lidar/RMCC): Airborne LiDAR filtering method based on Multiscale Curvature Classification
- [`RCSF`](https://github.com/r-lidar/RCSF): Airborne LiDAR filtering method based on Cloth Simulation
