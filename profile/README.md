## r-lidar

`r-lidar` is developing free and open-source airborne laser processing software primarily designed for the R programming language. Our two main products are the `lidR` and `lasR` packages, each targeting different usages.

`lidR` is tailored for research and development, originally developed at Laval University. It allows handy manipulation of lidar data within the R programming language. It has been widely used for 10 years by universities globally and has been cited in more than 1,000 scientific articles.

`lasR` is tailored for highly efficient airborne lidar data processing. It has comparable tools to `lidR` but was designed to be much more powerful and efficient. However, it does not allow for easy manipulation within the R language. `lasR` allows creating complex processing pipelines and applying them to terabytes of data efficiently.
